# Python Jobs in Workbench

Note: This page is using text from the [VS Code / Utilizing the Workbench Job Launcher](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/user/vs-code/guide/workbench-jobs.html) section in the Workbench User Guide. 

Long running tasks like simulation studies can be run as background or launched into remote resources in order to keep your original coding session open for other work.

## Usage in VS Code

### Access the Workbench Jobs pane

Navigate to the Posit Workbench Extension tab in the left sidebar to view the Workbench Jobs pane, which provides controls for starting new jobs as well as a list for viewing the status of existing jobs.

### Start a Workbench Job

Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right of the Workbench Jobs pane to open the Launcher options for a new job. This dialog is similar to the one in RStudio Pro. To enable the launch button, the job name must be specified, and the script extension must either be .r or .py.
