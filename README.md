# Posit Demo Assets

This repo contains demo assets to be used on the Posit Test Drive environment.

## What is Posit Test Drive

Posit Test Drive is a limited demo environment hosted by Posit to help you learn more and try out the various features.

## Video series

Do you prefer watching videos over reading? Check out the [end-to-end data science workflows video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6lh2u5pFhc&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oRsUB5AgNMQuKuHPpNDLBVt&pp=iAQB) for inspiration for what Posit Team enables your team to accomplish!

## Getting Started

Here you will find three products:

- **Posit Workbench** is your development environment for creating R and Python code and running large computationally intensive jobs in a secure and scaleable environment.
- **Posit Connect** is a publishing platform for hosting the work your team creates in R and Python.
- **Posit Package Manager** is a repository management server to organize and centralize R and Python packages across your organization.

## Milestones to Success
It can be very daunting learning a new system. Here are some useful resources to explore as you get familiar with the Posit products.

### How do I open a project?
#### R content

There are two ways to open an R project. 

##### Option 1:

1. Find the Files tab on the right side of your screen 
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to work in.
3. Launch the project by clicking on the .Rproj file

##### Option 2: 
1. Navigate to the project folder you want to work in.
2. Restore the needed packages into the renv environment.
````
    setwd("./R/shiny-penguins/")
    renv::restore()
````

#### Python content

1. Create a virtual environment in the folder you want to work in.
2. Restore the needed packages into the virtual environment.
````
    cd python-examples/dash-app
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Want to add an example?

Awesome!

For R based projects the requirements are:

1. Clone and branch this project.
2. Use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to record the r package versions used
3. Create a [`manifest.json` file](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/git-backed/#creating-a-manifest-file-from-r) to support git-backed publishing
4. Submit the Pull Request (PR) to have your changes added to this repository.

Updates for the environment can be done with: R -e 'renv::record("renv@1.0.11"); renv::restore(packages = "renv"); renv::install(); renv::snapshot(); rsconnect::writeManifest()'

For Python based projects the requirements are:

1. Clone and branch this project.
2. Create a `venv` to isolatle enviornments and generate a `requirements.txt` file so that only the minimum packages needed to support your project are included. Read [this](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/python/package-management/index.html) for more on Python package management.
3. Create a [`manifest.json` file](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/publishing-cli-notebook/index.html#creating-a-manifest-for-future-deployment) to support git-backed publishing
4. Submit the Pull Request (PR) to have your changes added to this repository.
