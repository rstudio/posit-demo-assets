## Pins <img src="https://pins.rstudio.com/logo.png" align="right" height="50"/>

The pins package can be used to publish data, models, and other R objects. Learn more about it here <https://pins.rstudio.com>.

## Palmer Penguins <img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="50"/>

The Palmer Penguins package is an R package created by Allison Horst that makes some data about penugins easily available to R users. Read more about it here <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>

This is what the data looks like:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  head() |> 
  kableExtra::kbl() |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

This is great if you have the `palmerpenguins` package installed in R. But what if you want to share this data with your colleagues who use python 🐍?

This is where `pins` can help!

## Publish data to connect using pins

With `pins` you can easily publish data (and other stuff) to connect. In a few lines of code I can save this data to connect as a *pin*.

```{r}
board <- pins::board_connect(auth = "envvar")

# Troubleshooting: errors can come up if the user doesn't match the Connect user, or if there is a piece of content on connect that already has that name
board |> 
  pins::pin_write(
    penguins,
    name = paste0(Sys.getenv("USER"), "/penguins_pins_r"),
    type = "csv",
    force_identical_write = TRUE
  )
```

You can now see the data on connect!

## Reading data from connect

Now that the data has been published to connect, you and and other uses can pull the data from connect.

You can easily read the data into R using pins:

```{r}
board <- pins::board_connect(auth = "envvar")

board |> 
  pins::pin_read(paste0(Sys.getenv("USER"), "/penguins_pins_r_demo")) |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```
