## Palmer Penguins

![](imgs/lter_penguins.png)

Palmer penguins is a data set provided by Allison Horst (<https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/>). The goal of the package is to provide an alternative data set for data exploration & visualization as an alternative to the `iris` data set.

Here is what the first 5 rows of the data looks like.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |> 
  kbl() |> 
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))
```

As you can see, the `penguins` data is much more fun then the `iris` data.

```{r}
iris |> 
  head() |> 
  kbl() |> 
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))
```

## Visualizing the data

You can make many fun visualizations with the `penguins` data set.

```{r}
fig <- penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill Length vs. Bill Depth",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
    color = "Species"
  )

fig |> 
  ggplotly()
```

Using tools like `ggplotly` you can easily make interactive visualizations. The plot above allows to compare bill length vs. bill depth by species of penguins.
